Mission: Build BANK! as a playable CLI game with human and agent players

Purpose
-------
This repository implements BANK! — a turn-based card game — as a mini application with three main capabilities:

- Playable CLI for human players (single or multiplayer)
- Pre-built agents (random, rule-based) for scripted play and reproducible matches
- Reinforcement-learning agents (DQN first) and a training pipeline to learn competitive play

Audience
--------
- Developers who implement features, agents, and training workflows
- Researchers experimenting with RL on discrete multi-player card games
- Players who want to run CLI matches or tournaments locally

Scope & Goals
---------------
Short-term (MVP):

- A stable game engine encapsulating rules and state transitions
- A CLI interface to run matches with humans and agent players
- A small set of deterministic agents (random, rule-based) for testing
- A DQN-based training pipeline that can be configured and executed locally

Mid-term:

- Extend agent API to support varying observation spaces and action masks
- Add tournaments, logging, and replay/inspection tools in `examples/`
- Build unit and integration tests for engine, agents, and training

Long-term:

- Improved RL agents (policy gradient, self-play), hyperparameter sweeps, and model versioning
- Integration with experiment tracking (e.g., Weights & Biases) and saved checkpoints
- Optional web or GUI front-end for live play and visualization

Observations about this repository (current state)
-----------------------------------------------
- Project structure already separates core concerns: `bank/game` (engine, state), `bank/agents`, `bank/training`, `bank/cli`, and `utils`.
- There are initial agents implemented (`random_agent.py`, `rule_based.py`) and a DQN agent scaffold under `training/` — good starting point.
- Tests exist under `tests/` for agents, engine, and config; this repo is already test-aware.
- `pyproject.toml` indicates a Python project with modern packaging; check CI later for test commands and linting.
- Docs and examples populate the repo but are not yet comprehensive; we'll centralize design docs in `docs/`.

Immediate next steps for contributors / coding agents
---------------------------------------------------
1. Keep this mission file updated with high-level goals and milestones.
2. Use `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/BASE_GAME_RULES.md` (created alongside this mission) as the canonical references when implementing game logic, agents, or training code.
3. When changing the public API of the engine or agent interfaces, update docs and add unit tests in `tests/`.
4. For ML experiments, provide reproducible configs in `config.example.json` and save model artifacts under a `models/` path (gitignored).

How to use this file
--------------------
- New chats with coding agents should start by reading `MISSION.md`, then `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/BASE_GAME_RULES.md` to get up to speed.
- The mission is intentionally concise; design details are in `docs/` and implementation examples live in `examples/`.
